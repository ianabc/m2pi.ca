I am a PhD candidate in the programming languages lab at the University of Calgary. My research interests mainly revolve around tangent categories and their applications to differentiable programming and Lie theory.

* Differentiable programming generalizes neural networks by allowing you to take the derivative of computer programs. Tangent categories provide a natural setting for the categorical semantics of differentiable programming languages. 
* The equivalence of categories between Lie groups and Lie algebras lies at the core of Lie theory. Using tangent categories, this may be regarded as an instance of enriched Gabriel-Ulmer duality.
